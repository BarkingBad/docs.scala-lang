### Experimental language features

All experimental language features can be found under the `scala.language.experimental` package.
They are enabled by importing the feature or using the `-language` compiler flag.

* [`erasedDefinitions`](./erased-defs.md): Enable support for `erased` modifier.
* `fewerBraces`: Enable support for using indentation for arguments.
* [`genericNumberLiterals`](../numeric-literals.md): Enable support for generic number literals.
* [`namedTypeArguments`](../named-typeargs.md): Enable support for named type arguments

### Experimental language imports

In general, experimental language features can be imported in an experimental scope (see [experimental definitions](../other-new-features/experimental-defs.md).
They can be imported at the top-level if all top-level definitions are @experimental.
