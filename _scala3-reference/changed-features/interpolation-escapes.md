In Scala 2 there is no straightforward way to represent a single quote character `"` in a single quoted interpolation. A `\` character can't be used for that because interpolators themselves decide how to handle escaping, so the parser doesn't know whether the `"` should be escaped or used as a terminator.

In Scala 3, we can use the `$` meta character of interpolations to escape a `"` character. Example:

<div class="snippet" scala-snippet ><div class="buttons"></div><pre><code class="language-scala"><span id="0" class="" >val inventor = &quot;Thomas Edison&quot;
</span><span id="1" class="" >  val interpolation = s&quot;as $inventor said: $&quot;The three great essentials to achieve anything worth while are: Hard work, Stick-to-itiveness, and Common sense.$&quot;&quot;
</span></code></pre></div>
