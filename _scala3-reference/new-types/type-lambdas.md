A _type lambda_ lets one express a higher-kinded type directly, without
a type definition.

<div class="snippet" scala-snippet ><div class="buttons"></div><pre><code class="language-scala"><span id="0" class="" >[X, Y] =&gt;&gt; Map[Y, X]
</span></code></pre></div>

For instance, the type above defines a binary type constructor, which maps arguments `X` and `Y` to `Map[Y, X]`.
Type parameters of type lambdas can have bounds, but they cannot carry `+` or `-` variance annotations.
