Say you have a list of pairs

<div class="snippet" ><div class="buttons"></div><pre><code class="language-scala"><span id="0" class="" >val xs: List[(Int, Int)]
</span></code></pre></div>

and you want to map `xs` to a list of `Int`s so that each pair of numbers is mapped to
their sum. Previously, the best way to do this was with a pattern-matching decomposition:

<div class="snippet" ><div class="buttons"></div><pre><code class="language-scala"><span id="0" class="" >xs map {
</span><span id="1" class="" >  case (x, y) =&gt; x + y
</span><span id="2" class="" >}
</span></code></pre></div>

While correct, this is also inconvenient and confusing, since the `case`
suggests that the pattern match could fail. As a shorter and clearer alternative Scala 3 now allows

<div class="snippet" ><div class="buttons"></div><pre><code class="language-scala"><span id="0" class="" >xs.map {
</span><span id="1" class="" >  (x, y) =&gt; x + y
</span><span id="2" class="" >}
</span></code></pre></div>

or, equivalently:

<div class="snippet" ><div class="buttons"></div><pre><code class="language-scala"><span id="0" class="" >xs.map(_ + _)
</span></code></pre></div>

Generally, a function value with `n > 1` parameters is converted to a
pattern-matching closure using `case` if the expected type is a unary
function type of the form `((T_1, ..., T_n)) => U`.
