A new annotation `@threadUnsafe` can be used on a field which defines
a `lazy val`. When this annotation is used, the initialization of the
`lazy val` will use a faster mechanism which is not thread-safe.

### Example

<div class="snippet" ><div class="buttons"></div><pre><code class="language-scala"><span id="0" class="" >import scala.annotation.threadUnsafe
</span><span id="1" class="" >
</span><span id="2" class="" >class Hello:
</span><span id="3" class="" >   @threadUnsafe lazy val x: Int = 1
</span></code></pre></div>
