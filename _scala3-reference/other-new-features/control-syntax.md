Scala 3 has a new "quiet" syntax for control expressions that does not rely on
enclosing the condition in parentheses, and also allows to drop parentheses or braces
around the generators of a `for`-expression. Examples:

<div class="snippet" scala-snippet ><div class="buttons"></div><pre><code class="language-scala"><span id="0" class="" >if x &lt; 0 then
</span><span id="1" class="" >  &quot;negative&quot;
</span><span id="2" class="" >else if x == 0 then
</span><span id="3" class="" >  &quot;zero&quot;
</span><span id="4" class="" >else
</span><span id="5" class="" >  &quot;positive&quot;
</span><span id="6" class="" >
</span><span id="7" class="" >if x &lt; 0 then -x else x
</span><span id="8" class="" >
</span><span id="9" class="" >while x &gt;= 0 do x = f(x)
</span><span id="10" class="" >
</span><span id="11" class="" >for x &lt;- xs if x &gt; 0
</span><span id="12" class="" >yield x * x
</span><span id="13" class="" >
</span><span id="14" class="" >for
</span><span id="15" class="" >  x &lt;- xs
</span><span id="16" class="" >  y &lt;- ys
</span><span id="17" class="" >do
</span><span id="18" class="" >  println(x + y)
</span><span id="19" class="" >
</span><span id="20" class="" >try body
</span><span id="21" class="" >catch case ex: IOException =&gt; handle
</span></code></pre></div>

The rules in detail are:

- The condition of an `if`-expression can be written without enclosing parentheses if it is followed by a `then`.
- The condition of a `while`-loop can be written without enclosing parentheses if it is followed by a `do`.
- The enumerators of a `for`-expression can be written without enclosing parentheses or braces if they are followed by a `yield` or `do`.
- A `do` in a `for`-expression expresses a `for`-loop.
- A `catch` can be followed by a single case on the same line.
  If there are multiple cases, these have to appear within braces (just like in Scala 2)
  or an indented block.

### Rewrites

The Scala 3 compiler can rewrite source code from old syntax to new syntax and back.
When invoked with options `-rewrite -new-syntax` it will rewrite from old to new syntax, dropping parentheses and braces in conditions and enumerators. When invoked with options `-rewrite -old-syntax` it will rewrite in the reverse direction, inserting parentheses and braces as needed.
