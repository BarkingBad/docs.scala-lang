The default Scala language version currently supported by the Dotty compiler is `3.0`. There are also other language versions that can be specified instead:

- `3.0-migration`: Same as `3.0` but with a Scala 2 compatibility mode that helps moving Scala 2.13 sources over to Scala 3. In particular, it

  - flags some Scala 2 constructs that are disallowed in Scala 3 as migration warnings instead of hard errors,
  - changes some rules to be more lenient and backwards compatible with Scala 2.13
  - gives some additional warnings where the semantics has changed between Scala 2.13 and 3.0
  - in conjunction with `-rewrite`, offer code rewrites from Scala 2.13 to 3.0.
- `future`: A preview of changes introduced in the next versions after 3.0. In the doc pages here we refer to the language version with these changes as `3.1`, but it might be that some of these changes will be rolled out in later `3.x` versions.

Some Scala-2 specific idioms will be dropped in this version. The feature set supported by this version will be refined over time  as we approach its release.

- `future-migration`: Same as `future` but with additional helpers to migrate from `3.0`. Similarly to the helpers available under `3.0-migration`, these include migration warnings and optional rewrites.

There are two ways to specify a language version.

- With a `-source` command line setting, e.g. `-source 3.0-migration`.
- With a `scala.language` import at the top of a source file, e.g:

<div class="snippet" ><div class="buttons"></div><pre><code class="language-scala"><span id="0" class="" >package p
</span><span id="1" class="" >import scala.language.`future-migration`
</span><span id="2" class="" >
</span><span id="3" class="" >class C { ... }
</span></code></pre></div>Language imports supersede command-line settings in the source files where they are specified. Only one language import specifying a source version is allowed in a source file, and it must come before any definitions in that file.
