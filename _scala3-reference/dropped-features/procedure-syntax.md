Procedure syntax

<div class="snippet" ><div class="buttons"></div><pre><code class="language-scala"><span id="0" class="" >def f() { ... }
</span></code></pre></div>

has been dropped. You need to write one of the following instead:

<div class="snippet" ><div class="buttons"></div><pre><code class="language-scala"><span id="0" class="" >def f() = { ... }
</span><span id="1" class="" >def f(): Unit = { ... }
</span></code></pre></div>Scala 3 accepts the old syntax under the `-source:3.0-migration` option.
If the `-migration` option is set, it can even rewrite old syntax to new.
The [Scalafix](https://scalacenter.github.io/scalafix/) tool also
can rewrite procedure syntax to make it Scala 3 compatible.
