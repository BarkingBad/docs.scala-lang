The syntax

<div class="snippet" ><div class="buttons"></div><pre><code class="language-scala"><span id="0" class="" >var x: A = _
</span></code></pre></div>

that was used to indicate an uninitialized field, has been dropped.
At its place there is a special value `uninitialized` in the `scala.compiletime` package.
To get an uninitialized field, you now write

<div class="snippet" ><div class="buttons"></div><pre><code class="language-scala"><span id="0" class="" >import scala.compiletime.uninitialized
</span><span id="1" class="" >
</span><span id="2" class="" >var x: A = uninitialized
</span></code></pre></div>To enable cross-compilation, `_` is still supported, but it will be dropped in a future 3.x version.
