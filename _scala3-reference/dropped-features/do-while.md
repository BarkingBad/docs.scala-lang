The syntax construct

<div class="snippet" ><div class="buttons"></div><pre><code class="language-scala"><span id="0" class="" >do &lt;body&gt; while &lt;cond&gt;
</span></code></pre></div>

is no longer supported. Instead, it is recommended to use the equivalent `while` loop
below:

<div class="snippet" ><div class="buttons"></div><pre><code class="language-scala"><span id="0" class="" >while ({ &lt;body&gt; ; &lt;cond&gt; }) ()
</span></code></pre></div>

For instance, instead of

<div class="snippet" ><div class="buttons"></div><pre><code class="language-scala"><span id="0" class="" >do
</span><span id="1" class="" >  i += 1
</span><span id="2" class="" >while (f(i) == 0)
</span></code></pre></div>

one writes

<div class="snippet" ><div class="buttons"></div><pre><code class="language-scala"><span id="0" class="" >while
</span><span id="1" class="" >  i += 1
</span><span id="2" class="" >  f(i) == 0
</span><span id="3" class="" >do ()
</span></code></pre></div>

The idea to use a block as the condition of a while also gives a solution
to the "loop-and-a-half" problem. Here is another example:

<div class="snippet" ><div class="buttons"></div><pre><code class="language-scala"><span id="0" class="" >while
</span><span id="1" class="" >  val x: Int = iterator.next
</span><span id="2" class="" >  x &gt;= 0
</span><span id="3" class="" >do print(&quot;.&quot;)
</span></code></pre></div>

### Why Drop The Construct?

- `do-while` is used relatively rarely and it can be expressed faithfully using just `while`. So there seems to be little point in having it as a separate syntax construct.
- Under the [new syntax rules](../other-new-features/control-syntax.html) `do` is used as a statement continuation, which would clash with its meaning as a statement introduction.
