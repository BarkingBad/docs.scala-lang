Early initializers of the form

<div class="snippet" ><div class="buttons"></div><pre><code class="language-scala"><span id="0" class="" >class C extends { ... } with SuperClass ...
</span></code></pre></div>

have been dropped. They were rarely used, and mostly to compensate for the lack of
[trait parameters](../other-new-features/trait-parameters.html), which are now directly supported in Scala 3.
