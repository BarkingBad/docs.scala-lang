In some situations, Scala used a _weak conformance_ relation when
testing type compatibility or computing the least upper bound of a set
of types.  The principal motivation behind weak conformance was to
make an expression like this have type `List[Double]`:

<div class="snippet" ><div class="buttons"></div><pre><code class="language-scala"><span id="0" class="" >List(1.0, math.sqrt(3.0), 0, -3.3) // : List[Double]
</span></code></pre></div>

It's "obvious" that this should be a `List[Double]`. However, without
some special provision, the least upper bound of the lists's element
types `(Double, Double, Int, Double)` would be `AnyVal`, hence the list
expression would be given type `List[AnyVal]`.

A less obvious example is the following one, which was also typed as a
`List[Double]`, using the weak conformance relation.

<div class="snippet" ><div class="buttons"></div><pre><code class="language-scala"><span id="0" class="" >val n: Int = 3
</span><span id="1" class="" >val c: Char = &apos;X&apos;
</span><span id="2" class="" >val d: Double = math.sqrt(3.0)
</span><span id="3" class="" >List(n, c, d) // used to be: List[Double], now: List[AnyVal]
</span></code></pre></div>

Here, it is less clear why the type should be widened to
`List[Double]`, a `List[AnyVal]` seems to be an equally valid -- and
more principled -- choice.

Weak conformance applies to all "numeric" types (including `Char`), and
independently of whether the expressions are literals or not. However,
in hindsight, the only intended use case is for *integer literals* to
be adapted to the type of the other expressions. Other types of numerics
have an explicit type annotation embedded in their syntax (`f`, `d`,
`.`, `L` or `'` for `Char`s) which ensures that their author really
meant them to have that specific type).

Therefore, Scala 3 drops the general notion of weak conformance, and
instead keeps one rule: `Int` literals are adapted to other numeric
types if necessary.
