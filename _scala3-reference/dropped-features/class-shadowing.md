Scala 2 so far allowed patterns like this:

<div class="snippet" ><div class="buttons"></div><pre><code class="language-scala"><span id="0" class="" >class Base {
</span><span id="1" class="" >  class Ops { ... }
</span><span id="2" class="" >}
</span><span id="3" class="" >
</span><span id="4" class="" >class Sub extends Base {
</span><span id="5" class="" >  class Ops { ... }
</span><span id="6" class="" >}
</span></code></pre></div>

Scala 3 rejects this with the error message:

<div class="snippet" ><div class="buttons"></div><pre><code class="language-scala"><span id="0" class="" >6 |      class Ops {  }
</span><span id="1" class="" >  |            ^
</span><span id="2" class="" >  |class Ops cannot have the same name as class Ops in class Base
</span><span id="3" class="" >  | -- class definitions cannot be overridden
</span></code></pre></div>

The issue is that the two `Ops` classes _look_ like one overrides the
other, but classes in Scala 2 cannot be overridden. To keep things clean
(and its internal operations consistent) the Scala 3 compiler forces you
to rename the inner classes so that their names are different.
